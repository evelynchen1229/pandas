FreecodeCamp - pandas foundation

1. pandas is built based on numpy
2. pd.Series - can change index from sequential number to meaningful  names (list like change to dictionary like data) - ordered sequence of list powered by numpy array and can have labels as index
3. upper limit for slicing is included in pd.Series if slicing by lables (postion indexing would be like normal python slicing - upper limit not included)
4.df.loc -- select row by index name; df.iloc -- select row by sequential order; df['']-- select column by column name
5.df.loc/df.iloc can choose multiple dimensions - df.loc[row,column];np array axis - row: axis 1; column axis 0
6.manuplication is immutable; mutable when you have "=" sign for modification
